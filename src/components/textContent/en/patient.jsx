      Each NFT represents one of the versions reported by the patient, but we
      need to know which is the real one. To answer the question of who the real
      GMT-03 is, we rely on Dr. Quasar's notes to give tips that will be
      released through our official channels such as Discord, Twitter and
      Website. Stay tuned to help us crack this case and secure exclusive

      "Who am I?" Is the question that echoes within patient GMT-03 at the end
      of every session reported to Doctor Quasar. After many trips through time,
      it is difficult for him to remember where it all started, where he is or
      where he will end up. The solution found was to bring up all his memory
      versions, represented through each NFT, to find out which one is the real
      one.
